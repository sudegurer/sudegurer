Hi, I’m Sude 👋

Data Engineering–Focused | Analytics & ML Aware

I design reliable, analytics-ready data systems by building end-to-end data pipelines that transform raw, unstructured data into structured datasets for downstream analysis and machine learning.

While my primary focus is data engineering, my background in statistics and applied machine learning helps me design data models and pipelines with a clear understanding of how data will be consumed by analysts and data scientists.

  What I Work On

• Designing data pipelines that transform raw, external data into structured,
  analytics-ready datasets
• Building ETL workflows that support downstream analytics and machine learning
  use cases
• Modeling and storing data in relational databases (PostgreSQL) with a focus on
  analytical query patterns
• Working with distributed data processing frameworks (PySpark) to understand
  scalability and performance trade-offs
• Creating reproducible data environments using containerization (Docker)
• Applying statistical thinking to data quality, preprocessing, feature design,
  and validation
• Bridging data engineering decisions with analytics and ML consumption needs

  Research & Applied Statistics

TÜBİTAK 2209 – Partial Least Squares Regression R Packages (PLSRegs)

Led a TÜBİTAK 2209-supported applied research project focused on addressing the challenges of high-dimensional regression problems, including multicollinearity, large numbers of explanatory variables, and scenarios where the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations.

The project concentrated on Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) from a software and algorithmic perspective. I developed the PLSRegs R package, which consolidates classical PLSR algorithms (such as NIPALS and SIMPLS) alongside more recent and computationally efficient re-orthogonalization-based methods (e.g., Bidiag-based approaches, fast PLS, hybrid PLS, and direct-score methods).

The package provides:
	•	Stable and efficient model estimation across multiple PLSR variants
	•	Prediction functionality for new datasets
	•	Example large-scale real-world datasets to demonstrate practical usability

This project emphasized software engineering, algorithmic implementation, and usability, and strengthened my ability to translate statistical methods into reusable, production-quality analytical tools.

Peer-Reviewed Journal Article – Statistics and Computing (2024)

Co-authored a peer-reviewed journal article proposing a novel robust and locally sparse functional Partial Least Squares method for scalar-on-function regression.

This research is methodologically independent from the TÜBİTAK project and focuses on the development of a new statistical modeling approach that integrates:
	•	Robust M-regression
	•	Sparsity for local interpretability
	•	Functional data analysis within the PLS framework

The method enables reliable estimation and prediction in the presence of outliers and leverage points, while accurately identifying zero and non-zero subregions of the regression coefficient function.

The proposed approach was evaluated through extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies and a real-world empirical dataset, demonstrating superior robustness compared to existing methods while maintaining competitive performance on clean data.

The methodology has been implemented in the robsfplsr R package, providing a reproducible and accessible software implementation of the proposed model.
