Hi, I’m Sude 

Data Engineering–Focused | Analytics & ML Aware

I design reliable, analytics-ready data systems by building end-to-end data pipelines that transform raw, unstructured data into structured datasets for downstream analysis and machine learning.

While my primary focus is data engineering, my background in statistics and applied machine learning helps me design data models and pipelines with a clear understanding of how data will be consumed by analysts and data scientists.

  What I Work On
	•	End-to-end ETL pipelines (APIs → transformation → relational storage)
	•	Analytics-oriented data modeling (PostgreSQL)
	•	Containerized and reproducible data environments (Docker)
	•	Distributed data processing with PySpark
	•	Data quality, preprocessing, and feature design informed by statistical thinking
